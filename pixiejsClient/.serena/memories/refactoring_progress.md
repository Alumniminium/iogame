# GameScreen Refactoring Progress

## Completed Refactorings

### 1. PerformanceMonitor (✅ Complete)
**File:** `src/app/managers/PerformanceMonitor.ts`

**Extracted functionality:**
- FPS tracking and calculation
- Frame timing (lastDeltaMs)
- Fixed timestep accumulator management
- Performance monitoring reset on pause/resume

**Benefits:**
- ~50 lines removed from GameScreen
- Reusable performance monitoring across other screens
- Clean separation of timing logic from game loop
- Self-contained accumulator management

**API:**
- `update()` - Returns timing data for frame
- `consumeFixedTimestep()` - Consume one fixed timestep
- `shouldRunFixedUpdate()` - Check if fixed update needed
- `getFPS()` - Get current FPS
- `getLastDeltaMs()` - Get last frame delta
- `reset()` - Reset timing on pause/resume

---

### 2. GameConnectionManager (✅ Complete)
**File:** `src/app/managers/GameConnectionManager.ts`

**Extracted functionality:**
- Network connection establishment
- Connection state monitoring
- Connection lifecycle callbacks
- Delayed connection initiation

**Benefits:**
- ~30 lines removed from GameScreen
- Clean separation of network connection concerns
- Reusable connection management
- Callback-based event handling

**API:**
- `startConnection(playerName, delay)` - Initiate connection
- `monitorConnectionState(interval)` - Monitor connection changes
- `getNetworkManager()` - Access NetworkManager
- `isConnected()` - Check connection status

---

### 3. GameInputHandler (✅ Complete)
**File:** `src/app/managers/GameInputHandler.ts`

**Extracted functionality:**
- UI toggle key state tracking (F10, F11, F12, B, Enter)
- Input packet generation for server
- Keyboard state management (prevent key repeat)
- Input state to button flags conversion

**Benefits:**
- ~100 lines removed from GameScreen
- Centralized input handling logic
- Clean callback-based UI toggle integration
- Removed KeybindManager import from GameScreen

**API:**
- `setUIToggleCallbacks(callbacks)` - Configure UI toggle actions
- `handleUIToggleInputs()` - Process UI toggle keys (called in fixedUpdate)
- `sendInput()` - Send input to server (called in fixedUpdate)
- `reset()` - Reset key state tracking

**Key Design:**
- Uses callbacks to decouple from UI components
- Tracks previous key states to prevent repeat triggers
- Handles both game input and UI shortcuts

---

### 4. GameUIManager (✅ Complete)
**File:** `src/app/managers/GameUIManager.ts`

**Extracted functionality:**
- All UI component initialization and management (10+ components)
- UI update logic for all panels and displays
- Pause/resume menu handling
- Settings page management
- Sector map toggle
- Chat box management
- UI resize handling

**Benefits:**
- ~200 lines removed from GameScreen
- Centralized UI lifecycle management
- Clean separation of UI concerns from game logic
- Removed 11 UI component imports from GameScreen

**Components Managed:**
- StatsPanel
- PlayerBars
- TargetBars
- InputDisplay
- PerformanceDisplay
- ShipStatsDisplay
- ChatBox
- PauseMenu
- SettingsPage
- SectorMap

**API:**
- `updateUI()` - Update all UI components (called every frame)
- `togglePauseMenu(isPaused)` - Toggle pause menu
- `toggleSectorMap()` - Toggle sector map
- `resize(width, height)` - Resize all UI components
- `setPauseCallbacks({ onPause, onResume })` - Configure pause callbacks
- Getter methods for UI components: `getChatBox()`, `getStatsPanel()`, etc.

**Key Design:**
- UI components initialized in constructor
- All components added to provided container
- Callbacks used to communicate pause state changes back to GameScreen
- GameScreen maintains pause state and input/system pause logic
- UIManager only handles UI visibility and updates

---

## Remaining Refactorings

### 5. BuildModeController (Not Started)
**Estimated lines saved:** ~250-300

**To extract:**
- Build mode state and toggle logic
- Build grid management and positioning
- Shape/component selection dialogs
- World grid pointer events (down, move, up, right-click)
- Build mode keyboard controls
- Ship part placement/removal logic
- Build controls text display

**Complexity:** High - lots of interdependencies with ship part manager and world grid

---

## Current Status

**Original GameScreen:** 1022 lines, 100+ members
**After 4 refactorings:** ~640 lines, ~60 members
**Lines reduced:** ~380 lines (37% reduction)
**Target after BuildModeController:** ~300-350 lines

**Lint:** ✅ Passing
**Type Check:** ⚠️ Pre-existing errors in other files (not related to refactoring)
**Build:** ✅ Successful

## Architecture Improvements

### Before Refactoring
```
GameScreen (1022 lines)
├── Performance tracking (FPS, timing, accumulator)
├── Network connection management
├── Input handling (game + UI toggles)
├── 10+ UI components
├── UI update logic
├── Pause/resume logic
├── Build mode (large complex feature)
└── Core game loop coordination
```

### After Refactoring (Current)
```
GameScreen (~640 lines)
├── PerformanceMonitor - Performance tracking
├── GameConnectionManager - Network connection
├── GameInputHandler - Input processing
├── GameUIManager - All UI management
├── Build mode (still in GameScreen)
└── Core game loop coordination
```

### After BuildModeController (Target)
```
GameScreen (~300-350 lines)
├── PerformanceMonitor
├── GameConnectionManager
├── GameInputHandler
├── GameUIManager
├── BuildModeController
└── Core game loop coordination (minimal glue code)
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Callback Pattern Works Well** - Using callbacks to decouple managers from GameScreen
2. **Getter Methods for Shared Access** - UIManager provides getters for components that other managers need
3. **State Ownership Matters** - GameScreen still owns `isPaused`, `localPlayerId`, etc., managers just operate on it
4. **TypeScript Strict Mode** - Had to be careful with Camera vs CameraState types
5. **Progressive Refactoring** - Doing one manager at a time made it easier to verify each step

---

## Testing Notes

- All refactorings verified with `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Pre-existing TypeScript errors in RenderSystem, ImpactParticleManager, SectorMap (not caused by refactoring)
- User confirmed everything still works after first 3 refactorings
- Build succeeds: `npm run build` passes
