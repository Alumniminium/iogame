ideas:

elements? water/fire/eart/air shapes, damages, defenses? easy with ecs
send back resources in some energy pod, display a camera until it arrives.
shield that expands from playerspawn and requires resources for upkeep and growth

Bugs:

Startup is slow, remove velocities on initial spawn, maybe avoid spawning objects inside other objects
Bullets dont feel right Rate of fire is too fast, They dont have kinetics, lifetime, death, nothing feels right.
Rotations from collisions suck
Thrust / Speed control doesn't make sense. You cant limit your speed.
Drops despawn too quickly.

## Frontend

Dynamic resolution - currently code in renderer.js, input.js (mouse position needs to be calculated based on the virtual resolution) and network.js (PingPacketHandler, as its a convenient timer)
^ I'm sorry future me

input box text length not checked, can out of range in the packet serializer trying to login

## ECS
Remove<Component> is the last thing that notifies systems of changes
