ideas:

elements? water/fire/eart/air shapes, damages, defenses? easy with ecs

####

Bugs:

Damaged shapes seem to spam send packets but couldn't figure it out - health system doesn't send.
Entities don't die properly
login race conditions are back due to lockless nature


## Frontend

Dynamic resolution - currently code in renderer.js, input.js (mouse position needs to be calculated based on the virtual resolution) and network.js (PingPacketHandler, as its a convenient timer)
^ I'm sorry future me

input box text length not checked, can out of range in the packet serializer trying to login

## ECS
move quadtree into ecs, hide the GetAttachedShapeEntity
AttachEntityToShapeEntity and Remove<Component> are the last two things that notify systems of changes
