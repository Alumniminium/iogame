# UNNAMED Multiplayer Space Survival Sandbox Game

> **Physics-Based Ship Building Meets Strategic Warfare**

A browser-based multiplayer space survival game where real physics, custom ship design, and complex supply chains determine your faction's fate. Build anything you want, but be prepared for the consequences of bad engineering and poor logistics.

## What Makes This Game Special

**Real Physics, Real Consequences**
- Your ship design directly affects how it flies
- Put engines off-center? Expect to spin uncontrollably when you thrust
- Too heavy for your engines? You're not going anywhere
- Every block placement matters for balance, thrust, and survival

**Complete Creative Freedom**
- Build ships using box and triangle components
- Add engines for propulsion and shields for protection
- Upgrade your parts with mined resources
- Your imagination is the only limit (well, that and physics)

## Game Modes

### **Faction Warfare** *(Coming First)*
Two player factions battle to destroy each other's base. Choose your role in the sandbox:
- **Frontline Fighter**: Engage in direct combat with custom-built warships
- **Miner & Hauler**: Extract raw materials and transport them to processing facilities
- **Industrial Engineer**: Design and build factories, storage systems, and production chains
- **Logistics Coordinator**: Manage supply chains and fulfill manufacturing orders

### **Survival Mode** *(Coming Soon)*
Unite against an ever-expanding alien empire that throws increasingly dangerous threats at surviving human players. Cooperation is key to survival.

## How It Works

**Ship Building Through Manufacturing**
- Every hull block and engine must be crafted from raw materials
- Design multi-block storage facilities (3x3 areas store thousands of one resource type)
- Place manufacturing orders at your faction's industrial base
- Factories automatically produce requested components from available materials
- Larger ships require extensive supply chain coordination

**Complex Supply Chains**
- Mine raw materials from space asteroids and deposits
- Transport resources to faction factories for processing
- Build multi-block storage facilities to stockpile materials
- Every ship component must be manufactured through the supply chain
- Order custom parts from your faction's industrial base
- Larger storage areas hold more resources with efficiency multipliers

**Physics-First Gameplay**
- Every component has mass and affects your ship's behavior
- Thrust, rotation, and momentum follow realistic 2D physics
- Poor design choices have immediate, visible consequences
- Master the physics to dominate the battlefield

## Perfect For

- **Creative Builders**: Love designing and testing custom creations
- **Supply Chain Enthusiasts**: Enjoy complex logistics and production optimization
- **Strategy Players**: Master resource management and faction coordination
- **Physics Enthusiasts**: Appreciate realistic movement and consequences
- **Economic Gamers**: Build and manage industrial empires
- **Competitive Players**: Test your designs and logistics against other factions

## Game Sessions

- **Quick Matches**: Jump in for mining runs or skirmishes
- **Epic Campaigns**: Full faction wars can last hours or even days
- **Flexible Commitment**: Play as little or as much as you want
- **Persistent Progress**: Your ship designs and resources carry over

## What's Coming
