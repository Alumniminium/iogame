 Production Efficiency Incentives:
  1. Speed Bonuses: Player-owned factories produce items 2-3x faster than
   central faction factories
  2. Quality Tiers: Private factories can produce "enhanced" components
  with better stats (lighter hulls, more efficient engines)
  3. Bulk Production: Personal factories can queue larger orders without
  waiting in faction production queues

  Economic Incentives:
  4. Profit Sharing: Player factories can sell excess production to other
   faction members for credits/resources
  5. Resource Efficiency: Private factories use fewer raw materials per
  item (better yield ratios)
  6. Exclusive Blueprints: Advanced ship components only available
  through player-built specialized facilities

  Strategic Advantages:
  7. Location Benefits: Build factories near resource nodes for transport
   efficiency, or hidden locations for security
  8. Customization: Player factories can be upgraded with modules (speed
  boosters, quality enhancers, storage expanders)
  9. Independence: Don't rely on faction politics - produce what YOU need
   when YOU need it

  Risk/Reward Balance:
  10. Vulnerability: Player factories can be targeted and destroyed by
  enemies
  11. Investment Cost: Require significant upfront resources but pay off
  long-term
  12. Maintenance: Need periodic resource inputs to keep running
  efficiently

  Social/Political:
  13. Industrial Corporations: Players can form manufacturing alliances
  within factions
  14. Reputation System: Successful factory owners gain influence and
  special privileges
